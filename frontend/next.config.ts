 * engines see exactly one canonical host). 308s are cached by clients and
 * treated by search engines as a permanent move.
 *
 * The old-domain rules only serve while cosmicsignature.bet stays attached to
 * the deployment — keep it attached (and registered) for the migration.
 *
 * Exported for `src/next-config.test.ts`.
