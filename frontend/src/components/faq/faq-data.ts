        answer: [
          "Chaos Zero is a prediction market on the Cosmic Signature game. Every game round asks the same simple question: will this round end with more gestures (bids) than the previous round? You bet YES or NO with CST tokens, and every winning token pays out exactly 1 CST when the round resolves.",

          "Chaos is the thing you bet on: a live gesture count driven by hundreds of independent players, publicly visible, impossible for anyone to script. Zero is what you have to trust to bet on it: zero oracles, zero admin keys, zero custody — resolution is just the contract comparing two public on-chain numbers.",

        question: "What are gestures?",
        answer: [
          "Gestures are bids placed in the Cosmic Signature game. Each round, players bid to win the round's prizes, and the market simply counts those bids. The count is public on-chain while the round runs, and it can only ever go up.",

The fee is set by an unusual mechanism: every LP declares the fee they want (0–10%), and the pool charges the share-weighted average of all declarations. The live fee is always shown in your quote before you confirm.",

Every bet is submitted with a minimum-tokens-out floor computed from your quote and your slippage tolerance (configurable in the bet panel). If execution would be even slightly worse than your floor, the transaction reverts instead of filling.",

        question: "Why did betting suddenly stop mid-round?",
        answer: [
          "The gesture count is public and can only increase. The instant it crosses the threshold, YES is already certain — so betting and liquidity-adding halt in that same block, and anyone can resolve the round early. This protects everyone from trading against a known outcome.",

          "Yes — any future round can be funded and bet on early. Use the round navigation arrows to move ahead. One caveat: a future round's threshold (the previous round's final count) is still forming, in public, and locks the moment that previous round ends. Expect the market to reprice on that reveal.",

          "No. Betting, set-minting, and liquidity-adds freeze when a round ends, but exits never do: removing liquidity, redeeming YES+NO pairs, and claiming fees keep working forever. Claiming winnings needs one resolve transaction first, which anyone can send.",

          "Every LP declares the fee they want bettors to pay (0–10%) when depositing, and can re-declare at any time without moving funds. The pool charges the share-weighted average of all declarations. Fee earnings are split by shares regardless of what you declared — the declaration is a vote on the pool's price, not a private fee tier.",

        question: "What are the risks of providing liquidity?",
        answer: [
          "The big one is informed flow. The gesture count is public while the round runs, so late bettors know more than the pool does, and that certainty accumulates against LP inventory. The per-bet fee is your compensation — you vote on it yourself — and you can withdraw the moment a round stops being uncertain.",

          "Yes, always — mid-round, after betting halts, after the round ends, even after resolution. You receive your pro-rata share of the pool as YES + NO tokens plus your accrued fees in CST. Paired tokens redeem 1:1 for CST; any unpaired remainder is market exposure.",

        answer: [
          "The first deposit opens the pool and picks the opening odds — later LPs join at the pool's current ratio. Misjudged opening odds are free money for arbitrageurs, so open near your honest estimate. The first deposit must be at least 0.001 CST, and the first LP's fee declaration becomes the opening fee.",

        answer: [
